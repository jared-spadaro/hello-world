Assignment 1 - malloc library

My makefile creates dynamic libraries (32 and 64 bit versions) as in
the example makefile. It also creates static libary versions and contains
a clean command to erase existing .o files and libraries.

Realloc was not implemented in this library, aside from the simple cases
where it is passed a null pointer or size of zero.
