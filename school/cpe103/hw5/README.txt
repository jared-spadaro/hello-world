I found this program to be the most challenging by far.

I implemented dijkstra's algorithm but was unable to figure out how to properly 
translate the 2d maze array to an adjacency matrix. I may have over thought the problem, 
but regardless, I spent a lot of time and effort on it and was unable to come up with a solution.

However I did get the start/end blocks to display properly.
