This was developed on a CSL Linux machine.

I attempted to test the root privelege portion on my minix image
but was unable to download the required libraries (crypt.h, 
termios.h, etc). As such, these portions are untested.

Included in the makefile is a chown and chmod call, to set the
owner of the executable "mksuid" to root and set its uid to owner, 
so that it can execute with root privelege. Of course, this means
that this program must be built by a superuser to run properly.
